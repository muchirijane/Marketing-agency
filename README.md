## About the site
This is a Marketing agency website made with styled components and react router. You can go to different pages easily and access the content. This was easier by the help of react router. 
I was able to code with the help of @Briandesign on Youtube. I got to learn how to use styled componets and react router for the first time. The learning isn't staright forward but with more practice and the documentation for refence, I will make more websites with React.
